i. Gender
=> In this column, we simply mapped like following:
Female = 0
Male = 1

ii. Age 
=> In this column, we are performing the normalization operation so that we can set the value between 0 & 1.

iii. Height
=> In this column, we are agian perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 1 & min. value= 0

iv. Weight
=> In this column, we are agian perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 1 & min. value= 0

v. family_history_with_overweight
=> This column basically has yes/no(binary) values. So we mapped the data like following:
yes = 1
no = 0

vi. FAVC
=> This column basically has yes/no(binary) values. So we mapped the data like following:
yes = 1
no = 0

vii. FCVC
=> In this, column, we are basically perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 1 & min. value= 0

viii. NCP
=> This column basically has yes/no(binary) values. So we mapped the data like following:
yes = 1
no = 0

ix. CAEC
=> In this column, we are mapping the data like following:
no = 0;
sometimes = 1;
frequently = 2;
 and then we are perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 0  and min. value = 1 

x. Smoke
=> This column basically has yes/no(binary) values. So we mapped the data like following:
yes = 1
no = 0

xi. CH2O
=> In this, column, we are basically perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 1 & min. value= 0

xii. SCC
=> This column basically has yes/no(binary) values. So we mapped the data like following:
yes = 1
no = 0

xiii. FAF
=> In this, column, we are basically perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 1 & min. value= 0

xiv. TUE

xv. CALC
=> In this column, we are mapping the data like following:

no = 0;
sometimes = 1;
frequently = 2;

and then we are perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 0  and min. value = 1 

xvi. MTRANS
=> In this column, we are mapping the data like following:

Walking = 0
Automobile = 1
Public_transportaion = 2
Motorbike = 3

and then we are perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 0  and min. value = 1

xvii. NObeyesdad

Insufficient_Weight = 0
Normal_Weight = 1
Overweight_Level_I = 2
Overweight_Level_II = 3
Obesity_Type_I = 4
Obesity_Type_II = 5 

and then we are perfoming the normalization operation; setting the max. value = 0  and min. value = 1
